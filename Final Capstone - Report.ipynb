Modeling accident severity prediction and improving the model are critical to the effective performance of road traffic systems for improved safety. In accident severity modeling, the input vectors are the characteristics of the accident, such as driver behavior and attributes of vehicle, highway and environment characteristics while the output vector is the corresponding class of accident severity."
